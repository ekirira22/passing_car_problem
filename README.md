# Phase 3 - Python Code Challenge

## Python Fundamentals
Authors: Eric Kirira Maranga && Diana Tuei

The following code challenges are meant to drill in fundamental concepts of python programming

### Challenge 1
There is a list of N Cars (numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1) arranged in a row. The cars are represented in a binary fashion where
0 represents cars going east and 1 represents cars going left. Implement a function that returns the total number of
crossing cars in the most modular way possible.
Write a function solution(A); that, given a list A of N cars, returns the minimum number of crossing cars

Examples:

        1. For A = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], the function should return 5.
        2. For A = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 7. 
        3. For A = [0,1], the function should return 1.
