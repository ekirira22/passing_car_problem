    John has recently discovered an online game. In the game, a 15-minute round starts in each quarter-hour period, starting at times notated in the format 
    HH:00, HH:15, HH:30 or HH:45, where HH is a number from 0 to 23. John uses a 24-hour clock, so the earliest time is 00:00 and the latest is 23:59. 
    
    John starts playing at time A and ends at time B. If B is earlier than A, John has played overnight (from time A to midnight and from midnight to time B). 
    What is the maximum number of full rounds that can be played by John?
    
    Write a function: 

        def solution(A, B) 
    that, given two strings A and B (in HH:MM format), representing the start time and end time, returns an integer denoting the maximum number of full rounds 
    that John can play within the given period of time. 
    
    Examples: 
        1. Given A = "12:01" and B = "12:44", the function should return 1. John can play only one round (from 12:15 to 12:30). He starts too late to play the round 
        from 12:00 to 12:15 and he will not be able to finish the 12:30-12:45 round. 
        2. Given A = "20:00" and B = "06:00", the function should return 40. John can play 16 game rounds from 20:00 to 00:00 and 24 game rounds from 00:00 to 06:00. 
        3. Given A = "00:00" and B = "23:59", the function should return 95. John can play four rounds every hour except for the last hour, in which he can play only 
        three rounds (23:00-23:15, 23:15- 23:30, 23:30-23:45). The next round would be 23:45-00:00 but John has to end 1 minute sooner, so he cannot take part in it. 
        4. Given A = "12:03" and B = "12:03", the function should return 0. John cannot play any round during an empty period of time. 
        
    Assume that: 
    • strings A and B represent valid times in a HH:MM format. 
    
    In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
