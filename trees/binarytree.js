    BINARY TREES
    1. At most 2 children per node
    2. Exactly 1 root node
    3. Exactly 1 path b/w root and any node

    HOW TO REPRESENT::
    1. We have to represent these as objects i.e every node will be an object or an instance  of a class
    2. The properties to store within this object would be the current value, eg. A in our current node.
    - But we also need to refer to children. Left and right pointers to the children.
    - In the case of (C) that has one child to the right you would have to use null or undefined for a non-existent child
    - The same will apply for leaf nodes
    3.
